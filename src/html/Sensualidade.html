        <h3> Careless Whisper </h3>
        <div class="EspaÃ§o">
                <div class="Letra">
                    
                    <p>
                        I feel so unsure <br>
                        As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor <br>
                        As the music dies, something in your eyes <br>
                        Calls to mind a silver screen <br>
                        And all its sad good-byes <br>
                        <br>

                        I'm never gonna dance again <br>
                        Guilty feet have got no rhythm <br>
                        Though it's easy to pretend <br>
                        I know you're not a fool <br>
                        <br>

                        I should've known better than to cheat a friend <br>
                        And waste the chance that I'd been given <br>
                        So I'm never gonna dance again <br>
                        The way I danced with you, oh <br>
                        <br>

                        Time can never mend <br>
                        The careless whispers of a good friend <br>
                        To the heart and mind <br>
                        Ignorance is kind <br>
                        There's no comfort in the truth <br>
                        Pain is all you'll find <br>
                        <br>

                        I'm never gonna dance again <br>
                        Guilty feet have got no rhythm <br>
                        Though it's easy to pretend <br>
                        I know you're not a fool <br>
                        <br>

                        I should've known better than to cheat a friend (should've known better, yeah) <br>
                        And waste the chance that I'd been given <br>
                        So I'm never gonna dance again <br>
                        The way I danced with you, oh <br>
                        <br>

                        Never without your love <br>
                        <br>

                        Tonight the music seems so loud <br>
                        I wish that we could lose this crowd <br>
                        Maybe it's better this way <br>
                        We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say <br>
                        <br>

                        We could have been so good together <br>
                        We could have lived this dance forever <br>
                        But now, who's gonna dance with me? <br>
                        Please stay <br>
                        <br>

                        And I'm never gonna dance again <br>
                        Guilty feet have got no rhythm <br>
                        Though it's easy to pretend <br>
                        I know you're not a fool <br>
                        <br>

                        I should've known better than to cheat a friend <br>
                        And waste the chance that I'd been given <br>
                        So I'm never gonna dance again <br>
                        The way I danced with you, oh <br>
                        <br>

                        now that you're gone <br>
                        (Now that you're gone) was what I did so wrong, so wrong <br>
                        That you had to leave me alone? <br>

                    </p>
