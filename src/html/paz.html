                    <p>
                        Days seem sometimes as if they'll never end <br>
                        Sun digs it's to heels to taunt you <br>
                        But after sunlit days, one thing stays the same <br>
                        Rises the Moon... <br>
                        <br>

                        Days fade into a watercolor blur <br>
                        Memories swim and haunt you <br>
                        But look into the lake, simmering like smoke <br>
                        Rises the Moon <br>
                        <br>

                        Oh, close you weary eyes <br>
                        I promise you that soon the autumn comes <br>
                        To darkin fading summer skies <br>
                        Breath Breath Breath <br>
                        <br>

                        Days pull you down just like a sinking ship <br>
                        Floting is getting harder <br>
                        But treat the water, child, and know that meanwhile <br>
                        Rises the Moon <br>
                        <br>

                        Days pull you up just like a daffodil <br>
                        Uprooted from it's garden <br>
                        They'll tell what you owe, but kwnow even so <br>
                        Rises the Moon <br>
                        <br>

                        You'll be visited by sleep <br>
                        I promise you that soon the autumn comes <br>
                        To steal away each dream you keep <br>
                        Breath Breath Breath <br>
                        
                    </p>
